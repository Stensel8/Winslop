This started as a joke.
Then Microsoft said “slop vs sophistication” out loud and it stopped being one.

Winslop is what happens when you take that idea seriously.
Not anti-Windows, not anti-AI, just anti-slop.

It removes the unnecessary stuff, tones down the rest and shows you exactly what’s going on.
No cloud, no assistants, no magic.
Everything is local, deterministic and reversible.

Under the hood it’s a very small, very focused fork of CrapFixer.
Nothing fancy. Just tools.
